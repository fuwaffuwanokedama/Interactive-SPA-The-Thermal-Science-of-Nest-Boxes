A scientific analysis of how artificial nest boxes can become "ecological traps" for wildlife due to poor thermal insulation.

# ‚ö†Ô∏è URGENT WARNING: When Nest Boxes Become Deadly Heat Traps

This project is an urgent warning about a critical issue: well-intentioned artificial nest boxes are becoming **deadly heat traps** for vulnerable wildlife, including baby squirrels, as internal temperatures reach lethal levels during extreme summer heat.

This is not a mere environmental analysis. It is a tool to demonstrate the reality of silent deaths through data and to demand immediate action.

## The Core of the Problem

* **The Lethal Temperature Difference:** We present the scientific evidence showing why natural tree cavities remain safe while artificial nest boxes can become fatally hot.
* **The Silent Victims:** This is the reality of what extreme heat does to helpless animals inside: dehydration, developmental failure, and death.
* **Actions to Save Lives:** Concrete, immediate strategies to transform a dangerous nest box into a safe refuge. Your actions will save lives.

## Confront the Data and Take Action

Use this interactive analysis tool to understand the severity of the overheating threat.

## The Urgency of This Issue

With rising summer temperatures, this is a problem we can no longer ignore. The nest box in your yard could be a sanctuary that nurtures life or a trap that ends it. This information is provided in the hope that it can help save as many lives as possible.
